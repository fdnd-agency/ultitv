Interactive Live Donations visualisation for ULTILEAGUE Prize Money

## Background:
ULTILEAGUE is the first mixed-gender Ultimate Frisbee league that prioritises fan engagement and innovation. The league focuses on online fan engagement and seeks to enhance the fan experience during live game streaming by incorporating interactive elements.

## Challenge:
Create an interactive and visualisation that enables real-time viewing of the prize pot of the prize money for ULTILEAGUE. The goal is to increase fan involvement and excitement during live game broadcasts while transparently showcasing the direct impact of people on the total prize pool.

## Key Objectives:
Real-Time Visualisation: Design a feature that visually displays live donations as they happen during the broadcast but also before and after. This could include a dynamic progress bar, animations, or other creative visual cues that dynamically update based on the incoming donations.
Viewer Interaction: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows viewers to make live donations directly on the website (using third party tools like Plink). This could involve integrating payment gateways and providing clear instructions for viewers to contribute.
Prize Money Impact: Design a mechanism to illustrate how each donation contributes to the overall prize pool. Provide viewers with real-time updates on how the prize money increases with each contribution.
Acknowledgment and Recognition: Incorporate a way to recognize and acknowledge donors during the broadcast. This could involve displaying their usernames, messages, or even special on-screen animations to celebrate their contributions.
Gamification Elements: Introduce gamification elements to incentivize donations, such as milestones that unlock exclusive content, different views like the top 10 listing today, this month, week or total.
Considerations:
User Experience: Integrate it in the current website or future website as a part not necessarily having to build the whole website. 
Integration: Ensure compatibility with JSON to for example display live donations on the stream our streaming software vMix.
Data Security: We need to have an email address when donations are made so that we can send the donors an email to vote on different things. 
Aesthetic Appeal: Maintain a cohesive design that aligns with ULTILEAGUE's branding and enhances the overall viewing experience.
